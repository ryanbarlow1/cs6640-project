# USU CS6640 Final Project
## A Study of Segmenting and Classifying Handwriting Samples Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project was created as a Python Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab. It is a study of handwriting classification and segmentation using TensorFlow (v2.17.1).

### How to run
Import into Google Colab. The datasets are pulled automatically in the Jupyter Notebook.

Note: This project requires more RAM than the T4 GPU hardware accelerator provides. For this reason, we recommend using either the A100 GPU or the TPU v2-8 hardware accelerator.
